# Suggest App

Find people with a nearly identical music taste and discover the favorite songs of your soulmates that you haven't heard yet.

## The Idea behind comparing track histories

Spotify offers a sophisticated mechanism to discover new songs, but it has never been the main source of my favorite songs. Friends with whom I get along well mostly share my music taste. Thanks to them, I often find new songs that I listen to on repeat. Therefore, I came to the assumption that people with the same music taste probably get along well and their favorite songs that you don't know yet could also become yours. This assumption is the basis for the idea of the app. By comparing playback histories, users can make new contacts and find new content that they really like.
